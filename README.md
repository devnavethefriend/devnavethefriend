Hello, 

I'm @devnavethefriend, a Python programmer who builds tools, automates data tasks, and writes backend logic that holds up over time. I focus on structure, accuracy, and writing code that solves practical problems without unnecessary complexity.
I've worked on dashboards, data pipelines, and lightweight applications using Python, pandas, Flask, Dash, and SQL. My main concern is keeping things maintainable and useful especially when it comes to data handling, reporting, and backend workflows.

# Tools and Languages I Use

- Python, SQL, HTML, basic JavaScript 
- Flask, Dash, basic Django   
- Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyXL, Seaborn  
- VS Code, GitHub, basic Docker  
- Pytest (for testing where needed)

# Projects

Built a dashboard for tracking sales and inventory using Python and Dash. It loads Excel sheets, cleans them with pandas, and shows visuals for performance analysis.  
A set of scripts for cleaning, organizing, and formatting Excel files automatically. Useful for repetitive office tasks and data prep.


# Currently Working On 
Building a backend template using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and modular routing designed for small to mid-scale APIs with clear folder structure and service logic.


# Availability

I am open to paid work - freelance, contract, or long-term roles involving Python, backend systems, or data workflows. If the task is clear and useful, Iâ€™m interested in building it.
